# Overview Content

Overview content is a key feature of your bot listing, allowing you to provide rich, engaging details about your bot to potential users. This guide explains the requirements and best practices for creating your bot’s overview content.

## Content Size

The maximum size for overview content is **250 KB**.

## HTML Content

Overview content supports **HTML** for rich formatting. To maintain a safe and professional environment, all HTML is sanitized before display. This means:

- Potentially harmful or unsupported tags will be removed.
- Scripts are not allowed.
- Content will render consistently across different devices and browsers.

**Need something simple?** We provide a special component to use Markdown instead! Simple use the following:

tofix

```xml
<db-markdown>
  # Hello World

  This is markdown!
</db-markdown>
```

## Custom Components

These components are designed to provide advanced functionality and visual appeal, making your overview more engaging and interactive. By utilizing these pre-defined elements, you can highlight your bot's features in ways that standard HTML cannot achieve. Examples include embedded charts, dynamic showcases, and interactive FAQs.
