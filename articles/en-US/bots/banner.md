# Bot Listing Banners

Bot listing banners are an essential way to showcase your bot's identity and attract attention on the platform. This guide explains the requirements and recommendations for setting up a banner for your bot listing.

## Setting Up Your Banner

Banners for your bot listing are sourced directly from Discord. To set or update your banner, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev).
2. Navigate to the application corresponding to your bot.
3. Navigate to the bot's settings.
4. Update the banner image in the designated field.
5. Save your changes.

Your updated banner will automatically sync with your bot listing on our platform.

## Banner Aspect Ratios

To ensure your banner displays correctly across various devices and layouts, it should adhere to specific aspect ratios:

- **Minimum Aspect Ratio:** 17:6 (ideal for default displays)
  - All banners are displayed at this ratio at minimum, if your banner does not exactly fit this ratio it will be cropped to the center to fit this ratio.
- **Stretched Aspect Ratio:** 10:2 (used for wider layouts)
  - Banners on listing page have maximum height of 240 pixels and a maximum width of 1400 pixels. Your banner will be cropped and centered to fit these constraints.
  - Design your banner’s primary content (such as text, logos, or critical visuals) to fit within the **10:2 aspect ratio**. This ensures that no important details are cropped or distorted when the banner is stretched.

## Guidelines and Terms of Service

All banners must comply with our platform’s [listing guidelines](#) and [terms of service](#). Key points include:

- **Appropriate Content:** Banners must not include offensive, explicit, or misleading visuals.
- **Copyright Compliance:** Ensure that your banner does not violate copyright laws.

Failure to adhere to these rules may result in your bot listing being temporarily disabled or removed.
